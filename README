Nanomsg example
===========================

This is an example of architecture in the case of multiple clients - single server.
The idea is to:
1) Use a REQ-REP protocol for the login phase. The login message contains the client
endpoint for direct server connection
2) The server spawn a new thread for each client. The thread connect a PAIR socket
to the client endpoint received in the login phase (see 1)

The user of a REQ-REP protocol allows the server to answer sequentially to each client.
After this synchronous phase, the server and client can communicate freely with a
PAIR socket.
